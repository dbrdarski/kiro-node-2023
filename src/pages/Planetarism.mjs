        <h1>Planetarism - Artistic Movement by Kiro Urdin</h1>
        <p style="font-size: 23px; line-height: 1.7em; opacity: .74; margin: 0;">
          Planetarism is an artistic movement founded by the Macedonian artist Kiro Urdin. This movement, which is both a philosophy and a practice, stems from Urdin’s deep-seated belief in the interconnectedness of all forms of art and the unity of human experience.
        </p>
        <p>Planetarism began in 1997 with the creation of "Planetarium", the first painting to be worked on at locations across the globe. Urdin’s journey took him to historical and culturally significant sites such as the Tomb of Jesus Christ and the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem, the Berlin Wall, the Great Pyramids in Giza, Machu Picchu, the Forbidden City in Beijing, and many more. At each of these diverse locations, he painted portions of an immense 48-square-meter canvas, which he carried with him, unrolling it to capture the essence of each place.</p>
        <p>This ambitious project was driven by Urdin’s desire to capture the universal human spirit and the richness of the world’s heritage in a single artwork. The painting, "Planetarium," serves as a symbol of this unity, blending the diverse influences and energies of the places he visited. The completed work, now housed in the Danubiana Meulensteen Art Museum in Bratislava, Slovakia, stands as a testament to Urdin's vision of global artistic synthesis, with its blue background symbolizing the cosmos and the forms and signs upon it representing a promise of universal joy.</p>
        <p>Planetarism transcends traditional artistic boundaries, integrating different art froms into a cohesive whole. This interdisciplinary approach is a hallmark of Urdin’s work, reflecting his belief that art in its various forms can bridge cultural divides and foster a deeper understanding of our shared humanity. Jane Teoharievski, speaking of Urdin’s work, noted, "Kiro Urdin is the founder of a widespread world cultural movement entitled planetarism which comprises art, film, video, photography, literature, dance, and design."</p>
        <p>The movement has been embraced by artists worldwide who resonate with Urdin’s vision. American choreographer Debbie Wilson, inspired by Urdin’s exploration of multicultural themes, created a dance piece reflecting these ideas. For Urdin, the journey to create "Planetarium" was not merely a physical adventure but a profound exploration of the human condition. It allowed him to experience firsthand the wisdom and traditions of various civilizations, from the Maasai in Kenya to the mystical Dogon tribe in Mali.
        </p>
        <p>Urdin’s films, like his paintings, explore the themes of existence, the interplay of life and death, and the pursuit of beauty and truth. His 1997 film "Dogs and Trains" poses the question: "What is closer to art? That which can be understood or that which cannot be done?" This inquiry reflects Urdin’s ongoing exploration of art’s role in understanding and interpreting the complexities of life.</p>
        <p>Through Planetarism, Kiro Urdin continues to challenge and expand the boundaries of artistic expression. His work is a celebration of life’s diversity and a call for unity and understanding across cultures. By creating art that is rooted in the specifics of place yet universal in its message, Urdin has forged a path that others are inspired to follow, building bridges between cultures and fostering a global artistic community.</p>
        <p>In summary, Planetarism is more than an artistic movement; it is a philosophy of life and art that seeks to unite people and cultures through the shared language of creativity. It is an ongoing journey of discovery and expression, with Kiro Urdin leading the way, ever faithful to his credo, which perfectly encapsulates the Planetarism movement:</p>

          "One point everywhere, everything in one point. One art everywhere, everything in one art."
