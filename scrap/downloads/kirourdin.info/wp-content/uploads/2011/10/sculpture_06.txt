TIME STATION
Everything can fit in a point: space, silence,
light, time.
Birth, time, death. But the point is time,
which means it can live anywhere and
everywhere. To be still, but also to be an
elypsis on the path of a star, a constellation,
the cosmos, the Universe…
As long as all is in it, it can become nothing.
It can die.
But, if a point can die, it also means it can
be reborn, because it moves constantly. In its
motion, it grows constantly, becoming the
biggest, becoming the Universe.
Therefore, it has to die again. In points. In a
point. Multiplied into universes. Universes
grown into a Universe. Universe - born in
a point. Point transformed into the soul of
time, so it can live in it.
And because of that it wants to freeze
in time, endlessly turning…around its
imaginary axis.
